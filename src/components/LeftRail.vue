      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        A lifetime creative, Nathalie sticks to painting the things that bring her joy. This leads her across the map of
        wildlife to fantasy creatures, figures to landscapes, and most definitely some pet portraits. Her illustrative,
        but varied, style draws inspiration from animation and the Japanese woodblock printing tradition. While she
        occasionally dabbles in other media, most of her work is in watercolor and ink. If she's not creating artwork or
        adding something new to her
        <a href="https://paperfox-tarot.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Tarot App</a>, you'll likely find her playing with
        her dog, or out in her garden.
